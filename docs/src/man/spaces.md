# [Vector spaces](@id s_spaces)

```@setup tensorkit
using TensorKit
```

From the [Introduction](@ref s_intro), it should be clear that an important aspect in the
definition of a tensor (map) is specifying the vector spaces and their structure in the
domain and codomain of the map. The starting point is an abstract type `VectorSpace`
```julia
abstract type VectorSpace end
```

Technically speaking, this name does not capture the full generality that TensorKit.jl supports,
as instances of subtypes of `VectorSpace` can encode general objects in linear monoidal categories,
which are not necessarily vector spaces. However, in order not to make the remaining discussion
to abstract or complicated, we will simply use the nomenclature of vector spaces. In particular,
we define two abstract subtypes
```julia
abstract type ElementarySpace <: VectorSpace end
const IndexSpace = ElementarySpace

abstract type CompositeSpace{S<:ElementarySpace} <: VectorSpace end
```
Here, `ElementarySpace` is a super type for all vector spaces (objects) that can be
associated with the individual indices of a tensor, as hinted to by its alias `IndexSpace`.

On the other hand, subtypes of `CompositeSpace{S}` where `S<:ElementarySpace` are composed
of a number of elementary spaces of type `S`. So far, there is a single concrete type
`ProductSpace{S,N}` that represents the tensor product of `N` vector spaces of a homogeneous
type `S`. Its properties are discussed in the section on [Composite spaces](@ref ss_compositespaces),
together with possible extensions for the future.

Throughout TensorKit.jl, the function `spacetype` returns the type of `ElementarySpace`
associated with e.g. a composite space or a tensor. It works both on instances and in the
type domain. Its use will be illustrated below.

## [Fields](@id ss_fields)

Vector spaces (and linear categories more generally) are defined over a field of scalars
``𝔽``. We define a type hierarchy to specify the scalar field, but so far only support
real and complex numbers, via
```julia
abstract type Field end

struct RealNumbers <: Field end
struct ComplexNumbers <: Field end

const ℝ = RealNumbers()
const ℂ = ComplexNumbers()
```
Note that `ℝ` and `ℂ` can be typed as `\bbR`+TAB and `\bbC`+TAB. One reason for defining
this new type hierarchy instead of recycling the types from Julia's `Number` hierarchy is
to introduce some syntactic sugar without committing type piracy. In particular, we now have
```@repl tensorkit
3 ∈ ℝ
5.0 ∈ ℂ
5.0 + 1.0 * im ∈ ℝ
Float64 ⊆ ℝ
ComplexF64 ⊆ ℂ
ℝ ⊆ ℂ
ℂ ⊆ ℝ
```
and furthermore —probably more usefully— `ℝ^n` and `ℂ^n` create specific elementary vector
spaces as described in the next section. The underlying field of a vector space or tensor
`a` can be obtained with `field(a)`:

```@docs; canonical=false
field
```

## [Elementary spaces](@id ss_elementaryspaces)

As mentioned at the beginning of this section, vector spaces that are associated with the
individual indices of a tensor should be implemented as subtypes of `ElementarySpace`. As
the domain and codomain of a tensor map will be the tensor product of such objects which all
have the same type, it is important that associated vector spaces, such as the dual space,
are objects of the same concrete type (i.e. with the same type parameters in case of a
parametric type). In particular, every `ElementarySpace` should implement the following
methods

*   `dim(::ElementarySpace)` returns the dimension of the space

*   `field(::ElementarySpace)` returns the field `𝔽` over which the vector space is defined

*   `dual(::S) where {S<:ElementarySpace} -> ::S` returns the
    [dual space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space) `dual(V)`, using an instance of
    the same concrete type (i.e. not via type parameters); this should satisfy
    `dual(dual(V)) == V`

*   `conj(::S) where {S<:ElementarySpace} -> ::S` returns the
    [complex conjugate space](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_conjugate_vector_space)
    `conj(V)`, using an instance of the same concrete type (i.e. not via type parameters);
    this should satisfy `conj(conj(V)) == V` and we automatically have
    `conj(V::ElementarySpace{ℝ}) = V`.

For convenience, the dual of a space `V` can also be obtained as `V'`. Furthermore, it is
sometimes necessary to test whether a space is a dual or conjugate space, for which the
methods [`isdual(::ElementarySpace)`](@ref) and [`isconj(::ElementarySpace)`](@ref) should
be implemented.

We furthermore define the trait types
```julia
abstract type InnerProductStyle end
struct NoInnerProduct <: InnerProductStyle end
abstract type HasInnerProduct <: InnerProductStyle end
struct EuclideanInnerProduct <: HasInnerProduct end
```
to denote for a vector space `V` whether it has an inner product and thus a canonical
mapping from `dual(V)` to `V` (for real fields `𝔽 ⊆ ℝ`) or from `dual(V)` to `conj(V)`
(for complex fields). This mapping is provided by the metric, but no further support for
working with vector spaces with general metrics is currently implemented.

A number of concrete elementary spaces are implemented in TensorKit.jl. There is concrete
type `GeneralSpace` which is completely characterized by its field `𝔽`, its dimension and
whether its the dual and/or complex conjugate of $𝔽^d$.
```julia
struct GeneralSpace{𝔽} <: ElementarySpace
    d::Int
    dual::Bool
    conj::Bool
end
```

However, as the `InnerProductStyle` of `GeneralSpace` is currently set to `NoInnerProduct()`,
this type of vector space is currently quite limited, though it supports constructing
tensors and contracting them. However, most tensor factorizations will depend on the presence
of an Euclidean inner product.

Spaces with the `EuclideanInnerProduct()` style, i.e. with a standard Euclidean metric,
have the natural isomorphisms `dual(V) == V` (for `𝔽 == ℝ`) or `dual(V) == conj(V)`
(for `𝔽 == ℂ`). In the language of the appendix on [categories](@ref s_categories),
this trait represents [dagger or unitary categories](@ref ss_adjoints), and these vector
spaces support an `adjoint` operation.

In particular, two concrete types are provided:
```julia
struct CartesianSpace <: ElementarySpace
    d::Int
end
struct ComplexSpace <: ElementarySpace
  d::Int
  dual::Bool
end
```
They represent the Euclidean spaces $ℝ^d$ or $ℂ^d$ without further inner structure.
They can be created using the syntax `CartesianSpace(d) == ℝ^d` and `ComplexSpace(d) == ℂ^d`,
or `ComplexSpace(d, true) == ComplexSpace(d; dual = true) == (ℂ^d)'` for the dual
space of the latter. Note that the brackets are required because of the precedence rules,
since `d' == d` for `d::Integer`.

Some examples:
```@repl tensorkit
dim(ℝ^10)
(ℝ^10)' == ℝ^10
isdual((ℂ^5))
isdual((ℂ^5)')
isdual((ℝ^5)')
dual(ℂ^5) == (ℂ^5)' == conj(ℂ^5) == ComplexSpace(5; dual = true)
field(ℂ^5)
field(ℝ^3)
typeof(ℝ^3)
spacetype(ℝ^3)
InnerProductStyle(ℝ^3)
InnerProductStyle(ℂ^5)
```

!!! note
    For `ℂ^n` the dual space is equal (or naturally isomorphic) to the conjugate space, but
    not to the space itself. This means that even for `ℂ^n`, arrows matter in the
    diagrammatic notation for categories or for tensors, and in particular that a
    contraction between two tensor indices will check that one is living in the space and
    the other in the dual space. This is in contrast with several other software packages,
    especially in the context of tensor networks, where arrows are only introduced when
    discussing symmetries. We believe that our more puristic approach can be useful to detect
    errors (e.g. unintended contractions). Only with `ℝ^n` will their be no distinction
    between a space and its dual. When creating tensors with indices in `ℝ^n` that have
    complex data, a one-time warning will be printed, but most operations should continue
    to work nonetheless.

One more important concrete implementation of `ElementarySpace` with a `EuclideanInnerProduct()`
is the `GradedSpace`, which is used to represent a graded complex vector space, where the grading
is provided by the irreducible representations of a group, or more generally, the simple
objects of a unitary fusion category. We refer to the subsection on [graded spaces](@ref ss_rep)
on the [next page](@ref s_sectorsrepfusion) for further information about `GradedSpace`.

## Operations with elementary spaces

Instances of `ElementarySpace` support a number of useful operations. 


## [Composite spaces](@id ss_compositespaces)

Composite spaces are vector spaces that are built up out of individual elementary vector
spaces of the same type. The most prominent (and currently only) example is a tensor
product of `N` elementary spaces of the same type `S`, which is implemented as
```julia
struct ProductSpace{S<:ElementarySpace, N} <: CompositeSpace{S}
    spaces::NTuple{N, S}
end
```
Given some `V1::S`, `V2::S`, `V3::S` of the same type `S<:ElementarySpace`, we can easily
construct `ProductSpace{S,3}((V1, V2, V3))` as `ProductSpace(V1, V2, V3)` or using
`V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ V3`, where `⊗` is simply obtained by typing `\otimes`+TAB. In fact, for
convenience, also the regular multiplication operator `*` acts as tensor product between
vector spaces, and as a consequence so does raising a vector space to a positive integer
power, i.e.
```@repl tensorkit
V1 = ℂ^2
V2 = ℂ^3
V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ V1' == V1 * V2 * V1' == ProductSpace(V1, V2, V1') == ProductSpace(V1, V2) ⊗ V1'
V1^3
dim(V1 ⊗ V2)
dims(V1 ⊗ V2)
dual(V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ V1')
spacetype(V1 ⊗ V2)
spacetype(ProductSpace{ComplexSpace,3})
```
Here, the newly introduced function `dims` maps `dim` to the individual spaces in a
`ProductSpace` and returns the result as a tuple. The rationale for the dual space of
a `ProductSpace` being the tensor product of the dual spaces in reverse order is
explained in the subsection on [duality](@ref ss_dual) in the appendix on
[category theory](@ref s_categories).

Following Julia's Base library, the function `one` applied to an instance of `ProductSpace{S,N}`
or of `S<:ElementarySpace` itself returns the multiplicative identity for these objects.
Similar to Julia Base, `one` also works in the type domain. The multiplicative identity for
vector spaces corresponds to the (monoidal) unit, which is represented as `ProductSpace{S,0}(())`
and simply printed as `one(S)` for the specific type `S`. Note, however, that for `V::S`,
`V ⊗ one(V)` will yield `ProductSpace{S,1}(V)` and not `V` itself. However, even though
`V ⊗ one(V)` is not strictly equal to `V`, the object `ProductSpace(V)`, which can also be
created as `⊗(V)`, does mathematically encapsulate the same vector space as `V`.

```@repl tensorkit
one(V1)
typeof(one(V1))
V1 * one(V1) == ProductSpace(V1) == ⊗(V1)
V1 * one(V1) == V1
P = V1 * V2;
one(P)
one(typeof(P))
P * one(P) == P == one(P) ⊗ P
```

In the future, other `CompositeSpace` types could be added. For example, the wave function
of an `N`-particle quantum system in first quantization would require the introduction of a
`SymmetricSpace{S,N}` or a `AntiSymmetricSpace{S,N}` for bosons or fermions respectively,
which correspond to the symmetric (permutation invariant) or antisymmetric subspace of
`V^N`, where `V::S` represents the Hilbert space of the single particle system. Other
domains, like general relativity, might also benefit from tensors living in a subspace with
certain symmetries under specific index permutations.


## Operations on and relations between vector spaces

Vector spaces of the same `spacetype` can be given a partial order, based on whether there
exist injective morphisms (a.k.a *monomorphisms*) or surjective morphisms (a.k.a.
*epimorphisms*) between them. In particular, we define `ismonomorphic(V1, V2)`, with
Unicode synonym `V1 ≾ V2` (obtained as `\precsim+TAB`), to express whether there exist
monomorphisms in `V1→V2`. Similarly, we define `isepimorphic(V1, V2)`, with Unicode
synonym `V1 ≿ V2` (obtained as `\succsim+TAB`), to express whether there exist
epimorphisms in `V1→V2`. Finally, we define `isisomorphic(V1, V2)`, with Unicode
alternative `V1 ≅ V2` (obtained as `\cong+TAB`), to express whether there exist
isomorphism in `V1→V2`. In particular `V1 ≅ V2` if and only if `V1 ≾ V2 && V1 ≿ V2`.

For completeness, we also export the strict comparison operators `≺` and `≻` 
(`\prec+TAB` and `\succ+TAB`), with definitions
```julia
≺(V1::VectorSpace, V2::VectorSpace) = V1 ≾ V2 && !(V1 ≿ V2)
≻(V1::VectorSpace, V2::VectorSpace) = V1 ≿ V2 && !(V1 ≾ V2)
```
However, as we expect these to be less commonly used, no ASCII alternative is provided.

In the context of `InnerProductStyle(V) <: EuclideanInnerProduct`, `V1 ≾ V2` implies that
there exists isometries ``W:V1 → V2`` such that ``W^† ∘ W = \mathrm{id}_{V1}``, while
`V1 ≅ V2` implies that there exist unitaries ``U:V1→V2`` such that
``U^† ∘ U = \mathrm{id}_{V1}`` and ``U ∘ U^† = \mathrm{id}_{V2}``.

Note that spaces that are isomorphic are not necessarily equal. One can be a dual space,
and the other a normal space, or one can be an instance of `ProductSpace`, while the other
is an `ElementarySpace`. There will exist (infinitely) many isomorphisms between the
corresponding spaces, but in general none of those will be canonical.

There are also a number of convenience functions to create isomorphic spaces. The function
`fuse(V1, V2, ...)` or `fuse(V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ ...)` returns an elementary space that is isomorphic
to `V1 ⊗ V2 ⊗ ...`. The function `flip(V::ElementarySpace)` returns a space that is
isomorphic to `V` but has `isdual(flip(V)) == isdual(V')`, i.e., if `V` is a normal space,
then `flip(V)` is a dual space. `flip(V)` is different from `dual(V)` in the case of
[`GradedSpace`](@ref). It is useful to flip a tensor index from a ket to a bra (or
vice versa), by contracting that index with a unitary map from `V1` to `flip(V1)`. We refer
to the reference on [vector space methods](@ref s_spacemethods) for further information.
Some examples:
```@repl tensorkit
ℝ^3 ≾ ℝ^5
ℂ^3 ≾ (ℂ^5)'
(ℂ^5) ≅ (ℂ^5)'
fuse(ℝ^5, ℝ^3)
fuse(ℂ^3, (ℂ^5)' ⊗ ℂ^2)
fuse(ℂ^3, (ℂ^5)') ⊗ ℂ^2 ≅ fuse(ℂ^3, (ℂ^5)', ℂ^2) ≅ ℂ^3 ⊗ (ℂ^5)' ⊗ ℂ^2
flip(ℂ^4)
flip(ℂ^4) ≅ ℂ^4
flip(ℂ^4) == ℂ^4
```

We also define the direct sum `V1` and `V2` as `V1 ⊕ V2`, where `⊕` is obtained by typing
`\oplus`+TAB. This is possible only if `isdual(V1) == isdual(V2)`. `unitspace` applied to an elementary space 
(in the value or type domain) returns the one-dimensional space, which is isomorphic to the 
scalar field of the space itself. Some examples illustrate this better.
```@repl tensorkit
ℝ^5 ⊕ ℝ^3
ℂ^5 ⊕ ℂ^3
ℂ^5 ⊕ (ℂ^3)'
unitspace(ℝ^3)
ℂ^5 ⊕ unitspace(ComplexSpace)
unitspace((ℂ^3)')
(ℂ^5) ⊕ unitspace((ℂ^5))
(ℂ^5)' ⊕ unitspace((ℂ^5)')
```

Finally, while spaces have a partial order, there is no unique infimum or supremum of a two
or more spaces. However, if `V1` and `V2` are two `ElementarySpace` instances with
`isdual(V1) == isdual(V2)`, then we can define a unique infimum `V::ElementarySpace` with
the same value of `isdual` that satisfies `V ≾ V1` and `V ≾ V2`, as well as a unique
supremum `W::ElementarySpace` with the same value of `isdual` that satisfies `W ≿ V1`
and `W ≿ V2`. For `CartesianSpace` and `ComplexSpace`, this simply amounts to the
space with minimal or maximal dimension, i.e.
```@repl tensorkit
infimum(ℝ^5, ℝ^3)
supremum(ℂ^5, ℂ^3)
supremum(ℂ^5, (ℂ^3)')
```
The names `infimum` and `supremum` are especially suited in the case of
[`GradedSpace`](@ref), as the infimum of two spaces might be different from either
of those two spaces, and similar for the supremum.

## [Space of morphisms](@id ss_homspaces)
As mentioned in the introduction, we will define tensor maps as linear maps from
a `ProductSpace` domain to a `ProductSpace` codomain. All tensor maps with a fixed
domain and codomain form a vector space, which we represent with the `HomSpace` type.
```julia
struct HomSpace{S<:ElementarySpace, P1<:CompositeSpace{S}, P2<:CompositeSpace{S}}
    codomain::P1
    domain::P2
end
```
Aside from the standard constructor, a `HomSpace` instance can be created as either
`domain → codomain` or `codomain ← domain` (where the arrows are obtained as
`\to+TAB` or `\leftarrow+TAB`, and as `\rightarrow+TAB` respectively). The
reason for first listing the codomain and than the domain will become clear in the
[section on tensor maps](@ref s_tensors).

Note that `HomSpace` is not a subtype of `VectorSpace`, i.e. we restrict the latter to
encode all spaces and generalizations thereof (i.e. objects in linear monoidal categories)
that are associated with the indices and the domain and codomain of a tensor map. Even when
these genearalizations are no longer strictly vector spaces and have unconventional properties
(such as non-integer dimensions), the space of tensor maps (homomorphisms) between a given
domain and codomain is always a vector space in the strict mathematical sense. Furthermore,
on these `HomSpace` instances, we define a number of useful methods that are a predecessor
to the corresponidng methods that we will define to manipulate the actual tensors, as we
illustrate in the following example:
```@repl tensorkit
W = ℂ^2 ⊗ ℂ^3 → ℂ^3 ⊗ dual(ℂ^4)
field(W)
dual(W)
adjoint(W)
spacetype(W)
spacetype(typeof(W))
W[1]
W[2]
W[3]
W[4]
dim(W)
domain(W)
codomain(W)
numin(W)
numout(W)
numind(W)
numind(W) == numin(W) + numout(W)
permute(W, ((2, 3), (1, 4)))
flip(W, 3)
insertleftunit(W, 3)
insertrightunit(W, 2)
removeunit(insertrightunit(W, 2), 3)
TensorKit.compose(W, adjoint(W))
```
Note that indexing `W` yields first the spaces in the codomain, followed by the dual of the
spaces in the domain. This particular convention is useful in combination with the
instances of type [`TensorMap`](@ref), which represent morphisms living in such a
`HomSpace`. Also note that `dim(W)` is here given by the product of the dimensions of the
individual spaces, but that this is no longer true once symmetries are involved. At any
time will `dim(::HomSpace)` represent the number of linearly independent morphisms in this
space, or thus, the number of independent components that a corresponding `TensorMap`
object will have.
