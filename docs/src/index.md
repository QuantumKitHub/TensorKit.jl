## Package summary

TensorKit.jl aims to be a generic package for working with tensors as they appear throughout
the physical sciences. TensorKit implements a parametric type [`Tensor`](@ref) (which is
actually a specific case of the type [`TensorMap`](@ref)) and defines for these types a
number of vector space operations (scalar multiplication, addition, norms and inner
products), index operations (permutations) and linear algebra operations (multiplication,
factorizations). Finally, tensor contractions can be performed using the `@tensor` macro
from [TensorOperations.jl](https://github.com/QuantumKitHub/TensorOperations.jl).

Currently, most effort is oriented towards tensors as they appear in the context of quantum
many-body physics and in particular the field of tensor networks. Such tensors often have
large dimensions and take on a specific structure when symmetries are present. By employing
concepts from category theory, we can represent and manipulate tensors with a large
variety of symmetries, including abelian and non-abelian symmetries, fermionic statistics,
as well as generalized (a.k.a. non-invertible or anyonic) symmetries.

At the same time, TensorKit.jl focusses on computational efficiency and performance. The
underlying storage of a tensor's data can be any `DenseArray`. When the data is stored
in main memory (corresponding to `Array`), multiple CPUs can be leveraged as many
operations come with multithreaded implementations, either by distributing the different
blocks in case of a structured tensor (i.e. with symmetries) or by using multithreading
provided by the package [Strided.jl](https://github.com/Jutho/Strided.jl). Support for 
storing and manipulating tensors on NVidia and AMD GPUs is currently being developed,
whereas support for distributed arrays is planned for the future.
